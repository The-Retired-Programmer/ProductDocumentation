== Introduction

The AsciiDoctor Project NetBeans plugin is designed to support the building
reasonably sized web pages and/or pdf documents from AsciiDoc sources.

It assumes that these documents are assembled from multiple AsciiDoc source
files, and assembly will be controlled by a top level AsciiDoc.

The plug-in integrates the asciidoctor and asciidoctor-pdf executables as
project node actions, so that asciidoctor builds can be completed from within
the NetBeans environment (Build book and Build webpage).

Identification of these Asciidoctor document assembly project is made by the
presence of one or more assembly file(s) at the root level of the project.

CAUTION: The predefined project node actions are limited to unix family systems
(ie Linix and MacOS), they were not designed/implemented for Windows devices.
