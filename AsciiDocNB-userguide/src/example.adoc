==  AsciiDoctor NB-Plugin by Example

=== AsciiDoc file recognition

Any AsciiDoc file (__.adoc__) will be recognised by NetBeans and will have
a Publish action included in it's popup menu.

If the file is not located
within a AsciiDoc project then the Publish action will create the published
document in a same folder as the source.

=== Publish a pdf article

To publish an asciidoctor-pdf article your AsciiDoc file will need to define 
options in it's header

[source]

:doctype: book
:backend: pdf
:toc: <1>
:revnumber: 2.0.2 <1>
:revremark: Early Preview Edition <1>

=== To repurpose an AsciiDoc file for both pdf and html publishing

To repurpose a file to publish in multiple formats, 
create 3 files - the source file (without headers) and two files which contain the necessary
headers and an include statement to add the source.

In __book.adoc__ set the options for a book and an include statement.

:doctype: book
:backend: pdf
:toc:
:revnumber: 2.0.2
:revremark: Early Preview Edition
:version-label: Release

\include::introduction.adoc[]
 
----

Select Publish on the __book.adoc__ file to create the pdf.

In __web.adoc__ set the options for an html document and an include statement.
Select Publish on the __web.adoc__ file to create the html.

\include::introduction.adoc[]

The resulting folder structure which will contain the two published documents:

=== The project structure

The project structure that is recognised by this plug-in is:

* an __asciidoc.properties__ file (no content is required).
* asciidoc files, located within the src folder
* resources (images etc) to be used in the Publishing process


image::resources/projectstructure.png[project structure]

The publishing process will create a __generated_documents__ folder.

There are no specific project level Actions.
  
The standard output and error streams are routed to the NetBeans Output Window,
while the published document is created in the __generated_documents__ folder. 

=== To assemble multiple AsciiDoc files for pdf and/or html publishing

One of the major use cases for an AsciiDoc project is to be able to
assemble multiple AsciiDoc source files into a book and/or html file.

Using similar techniques seen in previous examples, an AsciiDoc file for each output is created,
defining the options, and now a series of include statements define the
assembly order.
