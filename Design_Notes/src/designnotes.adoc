== Introduction

The term Pico-Hat could be confusing, could be either a PI Hat which includes a Pico
processor, or a Hat for a Pico.  In this case it is the former.

The Pico-Hat is a derivative by a solution by Luke Wren named
https://github.com/Wren6991/Pi400-Pico-Plate[Pi400-Pico-Plate].
Luke wanted a board that "connects a Pico to the GPIO header on a Pi400, without
any wires flapping in the breeze".

Pico-Hat's primary task is to provide
a platform for testing Pico code which had been developed on a Pi (the same as
the task of the Pi400-Pico-Plate).

However the Pico-Hat initial design goals were not to just emulate the Pico-Plate,
but also provide additional functionality in it's implementation.
It also should be capable of supporting the connection of additional hardware, in order
to support the development of Pico software which interacts with external components.

== The Pi400-Pico-Plate

I have include a couple of images from Luke's documentation, so that simple
visual comparison of the various products can be made.

== The Pico-Hat version 1

=== Design Goals

* To build the product without a custom Printed Circuit Board:

** To allow this variant to be constructed without PCB design skills.

** To allow any subsequent builder to easily customise the design.

* To build a conventional Pi HAT, rather that the specific Pi400 product.

* It also should be capable of easily supporting the connection of additional hardware,
in order to support the development of Pico software which interacts with
external components.

=== The Product


=== Operational Use


=== Design Review 

The product worked well as a software platform, validating the original
design of the Pi400-Pico-Plate.

Minor operational problems were observed which could be improved in a future design:

* The Pico pins are difficult to connect to, when using jumper wires:
** they are shorter that normal pins, due to their use to solder the Pico to the
board. 
** there could be residual solder on the pins which makes connection difficult.

* The pins are sometimes difficult to quickly locate, being all black.

* The USB connection being on the left hand side of the Hat was not in the best
place, when being used with a Pi400.  This was particularly obvious when
trying to also use a breadboard for prototyping where its natural position could
be to the left of the Hat.

* The reset switch is difficult to reach, being positioned to the far side of
the Pico.

* There is a lack of +5V, +3.3V and 0V pins easily available for prototyping use.
Using either Pico or Pi pins results in many jumper leads crossing the board.

== The Pico-Hat version 2

=== Design changes

Resolve all the issues mentioned in Pico-Hat version 1 review:

* Create a mirror image board design, rotating the Pico through 180 degress, to
position the Pico USB socket to the right of the Hat.

* Use dual sets of pins for Pico connections - the first being used only
the solder the Pico to the board.
The second being the pins for use with jumper wires.
These connecting pins to be mixed colours depending upon use:
** Red - 5V
** Orange - 3.3V
** Black - 0V
** Green - Pico data pins
** Blue - special Pico Pins
** White - Pi data pins 

* The design to include cutting tracks on the board to allow more freedom to install
components (such as the Reset switch) at more accessible positions.

* Add sets of power pins on the edge of the board:
** Pico: 5V and 3.3V
** Pi GPIO: 5v and 3.3V 
** Common: 0V

* Include 3 LEDs on the board to be able to monitor UART TX and RX, and
the SWCLK.  Thiese are shown on the schematic of Pi400-Pico-Plate but did not
featured in the latest PCB design.

=== Customisations

A number of possible customisations of the version 2 product have been thought
about.  These have not been included in this build, but could be
considered by anyone choosing to build a derivative of the V2 design.

==== Create a Pi400 dedicated version

Using a 20x2 right angled connector it would be possible to omit the use of the
HAT adaptor and GPIO socket, and make a direct connection to a Pi400.  The connector
should be fitted to come out of the top of the board (as per the Pi400-Pico-Plate).
About 16 wiring connections would have to be updated in the build (due to changes
to GPIO pin locations made by changing the connector).

==== Omit LEDs

LEDS can obvious omitted from the design, if they are not deemed a benefit.

==== And anything else that a designer may want to achieve

The design is not closed and so can be customised in anyway to meet your
individual needs.
