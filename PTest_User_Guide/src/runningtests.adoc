== Running Tests

The compiled tests and associated modules under test must be loaded into the Pico
processor.
Depending on the state of a GPIO pin the tests will be run immediately
the code is loaded, or the testing will be interactive mode and will be run when
requested.

=== Interactive Testing Mode

==== Selecting interactive mode

GPIO pin 22 is used to select interactive mode.
This is done by connecting this pin to 0V.
As this pin is adjacent to a 0V pin, use of a link can easily achieve this.

=== Automatic Mode (GPIO pin not connected)

All tests will be run immediately after the code is loaded,
in the order they were added,
and is equivalent to using the # command in Interactive mode.
Reporting of test success/failure will be written to the Pico UART0.
The format of messages will be the same as Interactive Mode.
The test sequence will be run once and then PTest terminates.
The tests can be rerun using the reset button on the Pico (if fitted),
alternatively the tests can be reloaded into the Pico.
