== Introduction

PTest is a small Test Runner library written in C, to allow
testing of C functions on Pico Hardware.

A compiled set of tests and the modules to be tested can be loaded
and run interactively.  Test can then be run individually, in groups, or the
complete set.
Alternatively the complete set can be run without user interaction.

The library includes:

* a test registration API
* a set of functions (checks) which can be included in the test code
* a run time trace buffer for logging progress
