== The Execution Environment 

The execution environment is the information available to an executor during its processing.

The key information in the environment are:

The Parameters::
Parameters are set as part of the executors command definition but also inherited
from any parent controls.

The input file locations::
Input files are selected from one of two locations (folders):
** The first is the content file location, it is initially the source level folder,
but can be changed to sub folder (as directed by the `path` or `inputpath`
parameters of the `Run` or `Use` command).

** The second is the shared input content file location which is always the
source level folder.

The input file selector will initially attempt a filename match in the content
file location and, if missing, will then attempt the match in the shared content
file location.

The output file location::
The output file location (folder) is initially the output folder but can be changed
to a child folder (as directed by the `path` parameter of the `Run` or `Use` command).

The in-memory file store::
The initial in-memory file store is created as an empty store for the main command
sequence. When a `Run` control is executed a new in-memory file system is created for use
by the new command sequence. If it is required to switch to a command sequence but to
continue to use the caller's in-memory file system then the `Use` control should be used
rather than the `Run` control.

Potential action on the in-memory filestore include:

** create new files (prepend the filename with !)

** append to the existing files, creating a file if it does not exist (prepend the filename with +)

** read existing files
