== Introduction

The Netbeans Platform Application Code generator is a Netbeans plug-in which creates
a set of artifacts to speed up creation of a NetBeans Platform Application.  These artifacts can
include:

* Database creation scripts
* Other utility scripts
* Entity classes and their associated Entity Managers
* Node class for all entities
* Explorer Views for all entities
* Editors for all entities

== The NBPCG script

The generation of these artifacts is controlled by a single NBPCG script which describes the necessary
build details, entities details and also the node relationships.  The NBPCG script is an XML document.
A template is available - using the New... entry, the template can be selected 
from the other category with file type NBPCG Definition file
