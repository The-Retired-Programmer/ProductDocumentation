== Introduction

The PostgreSQL NetBeans plugin supports the execution of PostgeSQL
files using PSQL.  It supports PgSQL and PLpgSQL scripts, providing an execution
action for any .pgsql or .plpgsql file.

These actions are in the file node's popup actions, and also in the
editor window's popup actions.

A PostgreSQL Project is recognised by the presence of an
__postgresql.properties__ file at the root level of the project.
The project will execute the scripts with a specific database, which is defined
in this file.

CAUTION: The predefined __.pgsql__ and __.plpgsql__ file actions are limited to
Unix family systems (i.e. Linix and MacOS).
No Windows implementation have yet been completed.
