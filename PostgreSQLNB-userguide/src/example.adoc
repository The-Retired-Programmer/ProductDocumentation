==  PostgreSQL NB-Plugin by Example

=== PostgreSQL file recognition

Any PostgreSQL file (__.pgsql__ or __.plpgsql__) will be recognised by NetBeans
and will have an Execute action included in it's popup menu.

However if the files do not exist within a PostgreSQL project they will not be
actioned.  A database context is needed to execute a command, which is defined
in the __postgresql.properties__ file.

The output and error streams from the execution of the PSQL program, are routed
to the NetBeans Output Window.
