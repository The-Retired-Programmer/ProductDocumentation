== Introduction

The PicoHat is a Hat for a Raspberry Pi host, which supports Pico Progranmming
in a convenient package.

This design was built on the work of ??? who build and documented a Pico Printed
Circuit Board specifically for the Raspberry Pi 400 (supply the necessary references).

This board is a more general in that it can be connected to any Pi.

It is build from a prototyping board, rather than using a pre-designed circuit board.

This allows any builder to make any customisations they wish to the design without
having any PCB design skills.
 
This is version 2 of the build.  Experience with version 1 resulted in small
changes which improved the usability of the board.

For full references to the original ???, and the PicoHat V1 and V2 design goals,
the builder should look at the Design Guide which provides the information.
