Some of The-Retired-Programmer projects develop NetBeans
Plug-ins (NetBeans Modules or NBMs).

This document covers installing these into a Netbeans installation.

Projects uses the GitHub Releases to record the formal releases.  In addition
the NBM file created as part of the release in stored within the release information.

For a fuller description of The-Retired_Programmer use of GitHub as repository,
please look at: https://www.the-retired-programmer.uk/githubdevelopmentnotes.html

=== Step to install a NBM.

WARNING: Ensure any dependencies on other NBM are satisfied, by loading these
NBMs prior to your project NBM,

Download the latest version of the required NBM to your local machine.

Click on the NetBeans Tools>Plugins menu item to display the Plugin dialog
screen.

and then selecting "Show details"
