My decision to use AsciiDoc and JBake to publish this
website has resulted in a review to needs to support the existing array of
products which have been documented on this site.

Extexp, which is a publishing toolchain, is now redundant and so will be
*Retired* immediately.

All current documentation associated with Retired products will remain on this
website but will be found in a new Retired Section.  Sources for the products
will remain on GitHub, but will be set to Archived status (read  only).
