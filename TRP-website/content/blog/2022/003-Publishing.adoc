Following my decision to use AsciiDoc and JBake to publish this
website and other documents, I have started to develop tools to support these
processes.

To enable my IDE of choice (NetBeans), these will be in the form of
NetBeans plug-ins.
These plugins will initially provide basic support for JBake and AsciiDoc
projects.
Integration of the respective toolchains will be a high priority for early development.

Watch out for future posts on this subject and the documentation associated with
these NetBeans plugins.
