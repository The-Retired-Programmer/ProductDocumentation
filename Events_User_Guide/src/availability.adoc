All the information in this document expects the Application Project and Pico-Lib
to be installed within the pico directory (as built with the standard Raspberry Pi
installation scripts).
Thus expected folder structure would be similar to:

[source]
----
    |
    |- pico -
    |       |- my application - ...
    |       |- PicoLib -
    |       |          |- src -
    |       |                 |- events - ...
    |       | - pico-sdk - ...
----

However the user is free to use whatever folder structure they would like,
changing their build system appropriately.
