== Introduction

The Event Handler is an event queue and sequenual event processor for the Pico processor.
It currently handles GPIO events and timer events.
It will be expanded in the future to handle other event types.

The GPIO source of events optionally includes a GPIO software debouncer, implemented within
the PIO hardware of the PICO.

The timer allow the generation of periodic events.
