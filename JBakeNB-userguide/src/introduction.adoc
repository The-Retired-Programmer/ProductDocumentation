== Introduction

The JBake Project NetBeans plugin is designed to support the JBake WebSite
builder.

It currently provides basic Netbeans Project support for a site being
built by JBake.
This includes:

* Identification of JBake websites - by the presence of
a _jbake.properties_ file at the root level of the project.

* Capability to run the JBake executable from within Netbeans.
This is provided as a project node action.

* Additional executables or scripts may be added to a project node as actions, allowing
more commands to be added at the individual project level.

No features of JBake are thought to be masked by this plug-in.

CAUTION: The predefined project node actions are limited to unix family systems
(ie Linix and MacOS). No Windows implementation have yet been completed.
This does not stop a user attempting to use the additional CLI actions
capability to execute the JBake -b command, but the provided Bake action
does not yet work for Windows.
