== Introduction

The JBake Project NetBeans plugin supports the JBake WebSite builder.

It provides basic Netbeans Project support for a site being built by JBake.
This includes:

* Identification of JBake projects - by the presence of
a _jbake.properties_ file at the root level of the project.

* Capability to run the JBake executable from within NetBeans.
This is provided as a project node action.

* Additional executables or scripts may be added as project node actions, allowing
commands to be defined at the project level (using the
__projectactions.properties file to define these).

No features of JBake are thought to be masked by this plug-in.

CAUTION: The predefined project node actions are limited to Unix family systems
(i.e. Linix and MacOS). No Windows implementation have yet been completed.
This does not stop a user attempting to use the additional CLI actions
capability to execute the JBake -b command, but the built-in Bake action
may not work with Windows.
