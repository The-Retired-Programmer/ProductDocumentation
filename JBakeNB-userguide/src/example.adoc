The projectactions file structue is defined in the
https://www.theretiredprogrammer.uk/tags/Actions%20Support.html[ActionsSupport]
documentation, but a basic example is show here.  The file defines an additional
action to be added which starts jwebserver (to enable viewing of the
generated website).

1.label = Start project test webserver
1.command = jwebserver
1.commandargs = -d ${NODEPATH}/output/
1.tabname = Test Webserver for TRP-website
1.killcommand = q
1.cleartab = every execution
