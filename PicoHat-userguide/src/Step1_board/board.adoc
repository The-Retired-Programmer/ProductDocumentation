== Step 1: Prepare the Board

As noted in the Design Guide, selection of a prototyping board which has the
capability of both carrying a Pico and also a standard Pi GPIO connector (20x2)
was limited.

To achieve all the features desired in V2 the basic form of the selected board
was insufficient and some adaptations are required (cutting tracks to create
more independent pads for component interconnection).

The first steps of the build is to complete these cuts.

The following cuts are to be made:

Cuts are carefully made using a scalpel to break the tracks, cutting to
remove small amounts of the trace between the solder pads.

I used a meter to check for any continuity across the cut and ensure complete
isolation.
