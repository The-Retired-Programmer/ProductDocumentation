== The-Retired-Programmer


As a software engineer with over 40 years experience of software development, product
delivery and project management, I have wide range of experience in the profession.
Now retired I have returned to my roots as a programmer continuing to build software
solutions.


My interests are in the areas of embedded solutions (particularly based on the Raspberry Pi
family of products - both the Pico and the Pi), and also small software solutions
aimed at my personal productivity, which others might find useful.


In keeping with encouraging general use, my software solutions are
available on GitHub, with open source licensing (Apache v2.0).

This site provides both documentation and news items for these solutions.
