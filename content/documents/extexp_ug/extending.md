## Extending Extexp ##

Extexp is designed for extendability. At the simplest level the
External command runs any executable to process textual data.

However to allow a developer to completely integrate a new command into the processor
it is possible to create an additional NetBeans module which adds one or more commands, 
with full integration (the parameters, in-memory file store, Preferences URI,
and visual display) with Extexp.
