== Introduction

The Netbeans Platform Application Code generator is a Netbeans plug-in which creates
a set of artifacts to speed up creation of a NetBeans Platform Application.  These artifacts can
include:

* Database creation scripts
* Other utility scripts
* Entity classes and their associated Entity Managers
* Node class for all entities
* Explorer Views for all entities
* Editors for all entities

== The NBPCG script

The generation of these artifacts is controlled by a single NBPCG script which describes the necessary
build details, entities details and also the node relationships.  The NBPCG script is an XML document.
A template is available - using the New... entry, the template can be selected 
from the other category with file type NBPCG Definition file

For full details of the content and syntax of the script file can be found
