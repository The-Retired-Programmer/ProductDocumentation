You’ll have noticed something a bit different when you visit
The-Retired-Programmer today.

I wanted to start sharing additional information, while continuing to support
the previous content of the site (documentation for various packages).

The new approach to organising the site will be a combination of a news feed
and Document store. News items being single page information, presented in a time based
manner. Documents can be multipaged, with page based access.

Both News items and Documents can be associated with Products.  This allows a
simple mechanism to access list of items associated with a particular subject area.

The initial content will be that of the previous website (ie covering the EXTEXP
and NBPCG software), so these will be the initial projects.  Other projects will be added as necessary.
